            <p>The show was amazing! Seeing Louis perform live was even better than I could've imagined. I loved how he adapted some of his past songs and 1D songs to fit a more rock vibe. Venue staff was very nice and helpful.

              Louisâ€™ concert was the best concert I have ever attended! The atmosphere was so welcoming and fun! Louis stage presence was so amazing that as soon as he walked in stage I started shaking from excitement! I would definitely attend his future shows!

              I couldnâ€™t believe that I saw Louis live. If felt like a fever dream. The opening acts were amazing. The merch line was long but it went by so quick. It took us literally 2 minutes to get inside the venue. My experience was 9.5/10! Iâ€™d recommend going to Louis show atleast once in your life, you wonâ€™t regret it.

              I went with my husband and daughter to Louis' concert at the Toyota Music Pavillion in Irving and we had the best night ever! We came all the way from Germany and were so surprised how fast we got in and out if the venue/parking! The will call people and all the other stuff was super friendly. We loved the vibe of the venue and most of all the amazing show of Louis' and his openers Andrew Cushin and The snuts. Louis is just a ray of sunshine who puts all of his heart into his music and als a concertgoer you get to feel that! Sadly the show went by so quickly, but after the show is before the next show... ðŸ˜‰

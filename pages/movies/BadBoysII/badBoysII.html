              Will Smith is my favorite actor of all time and he has never failed to amuse me with everything he does especially in the Bad Boys franchise so i had to rewatch this movie for the 100th time to remember what a masterpiece this movie was and still is!

              Murder Mystery 2 was a great way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon. It's not the most thought-provoking film, but it's sure to entertain you. The cast is great and the story is just enough of a mystery to keep you guessing. I'd definitely recommend it to fans of the first film or anyone who just wants a fun, light-hearted comedy.

              Murder Mystery 2 was a bit of a mixed bag for me. The first half of the film was really funny, but the second half fell a bit flat. The plot was predictable and the jokes didn't land as well. Still, it was an enjoyable enough way to spend a couple of hours.

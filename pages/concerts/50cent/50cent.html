              I saw Busta Rhymes at the SOAW fest in May 2023 and his performance was one of the best hip hop performances I have ever seen! He was so much fun to rap with and dance to! I can't wait for this tour to see him again!

              I saw the Iconic Mogul 50 Cent perform at a cute venue in the Lover Westside section of Manhattan NYC and I absolutely enjoyed the entire performance. 50 Cent‚Äôs stage presence is an iconic one of kind experience! It was exciting to see 50 Cent perform and I would pay ANY amount of money to see him perform again on his upcoming The Final Lap concert World Tour this summer!            </p>

              Title says it all, 50 Cent played for about 10-15min, and a DJ played for the rest of the night. Ended up leaving early.            </p>

              50 looked great and it was a blast from the past getting to see him. He was unfortunately like 2 3 hours late. Played a few songs and never even thanked boston for coming out to see him. Show was just over. It was more like he was just a club singing and having fun. Not like everyone paid 100s to see him. The girls bringing him drinks put on more of a show. Disappointed. And busta rhymes and Jeremiah wasnt even there. Super disappointed. And wayyyyy over crowded!            </p>

              This was not worth $125! Sounded like 3 drunk guys singing karaoke. Came on at 12:30 am and was done by 12:45 am. Maybe his actual concert would be better but they had no right charging that much for 15 minutes.            </p>
